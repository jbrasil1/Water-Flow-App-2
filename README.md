**Water Flow App**

This Flask app, created with the help of AI, lets the user find real time data flow from USGS monitoring cites within California. The home page lets the user input a California county, which then brings up a second page showing available monitoring stations. After selecting a station another page is brought up which shows the most recent available data from that station.
